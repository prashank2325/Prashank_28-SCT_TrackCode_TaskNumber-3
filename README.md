# Decision Tree Classifier for Bank Marketing Dataset

## Project Overview

This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data from the Bank Marketing dataset. The goal is to uncover insights into customer behavior and identify key factors influencing their decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Bank Marketing dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing). It contains various attributes related to customers and their responses to marketing campaigns.

### Features

The following features are included in the analysis:
- **Demographic Features**:
  - Age
  - Job
  - Marital Status
  - Education

- **Behavioral Features**:
  - Balance
  - Day of Last Contact
  - Duration of Last Contact
  - Number of Contacts During the Campaign
  - Days Since Previous Contact
  - Number of Previous Contacts

### Target Variable
- **Subscription Status**: Indicates whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit (yes/no).

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-tree-bank-marketing.git
   cd decision-tree-bank-marketing
   ```

2. **Run the Python script**:
   ```bash
   python decision_tree_classifier.py
   ```

   Ensure you update the file path in the script to the location of the `bank-full.csv` file on your machine.

## Code Explanation

The code consists of the following main steps:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Essential libraries for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization are imported.

2. **Loading the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded from a specified file path.

3. **Feature Selection**: Relevant demographic and behavioral features are selected for analysis.

4. **Data Preprocessing**: Categorical features are encoded using LabelEncoder to facilitate processing by the decision tree model.

5. **Splitting the Data**: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

6. **Training the Model**: A Decision Tree Classifier is trained on the training set.

7. **Model Evaluation**: The accuracy of the model is calculated on the test set.

8. **Visualization**: The decision tree is visualized to understand the decision-making process.

## Results

The model's accuracy is printed to the console, indicating how well the classifier performed in predicting customer subscriptions. A visual representation of the decision tree is also displayed.
